# 01/27-auto-complete-input

This project is all about creating a user-friendly and efficient auto-complete input box. I will be working on developing an input box that can automatically suggest and complete words and phrases based on the user's input.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/). and will use this fruit api [https://fruityvice.com/](https://fruityvice.com/) for data fetching.
